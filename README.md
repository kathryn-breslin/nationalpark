# National Park Search
#### An application to help you find your nearest National Park!

## About
This is a **full-stack React** application built to help users discover their nearest National Park! As users search by State (ex., "California" or "CA"), the applications calls the **National Parks API** and displays the coordinating responses. The data returned from the National Parks API is stored in a **Mongoose database**. 

Each individual response is built to either take the user through to it's unique page or the National Park's pre-built page. The unique pages for each park detail its location, using the **Google Maps API**, history of the Park and documented images,supported by the **Flickr API**.  

This application is in it's first phase of production. It is built using **React**, **Express**, **Mongoose**, **Axios**, and various APIs including the **National Parks API**, **Google Maps** and **Flickr**.
